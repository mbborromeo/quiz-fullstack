# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is a Quiz app referenced from YouTube tutorial ["MERN Stack Complete Quiz Application - Full Course" ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNN4o4gnSF4) by Daily Tuition.

It is a Full-Stack project, so there is a 'client' folder and 'server' folder. The front-end/client side is built in React, and the server side is built in Express and MongoDB. You will need to run `npm run start` from both folders. There is a Readme.md file in both 'client' and 'server' folders
